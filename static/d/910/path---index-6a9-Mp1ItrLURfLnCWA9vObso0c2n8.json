The truth is that these issues are commonly experienced by most men. </p>\n<p>But why here? In my experience, the kind of issues I will be discussing here are either </p>\n<ul>\n<li>not being talked about elsewhere, where you might reasonably expect them to be (ie. family or church). </li>\n<li>not being talked about constructively, due to lack of honest, transparent community </li>\n<li>or not being dealt with effectively, due to lack of experience with lasting change.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My hope is that this blog will play a part in enabling men to talk about these issues in a way that builds community, dissipates the shame, and leads to personal freedom.</p>\n<p>What can you do?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/subscribe\">Subscribe</a> to get notified when there is new content.</li>\n<li>Participate in the comments.
