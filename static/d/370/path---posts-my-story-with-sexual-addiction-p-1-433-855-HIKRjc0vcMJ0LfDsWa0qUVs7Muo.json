During those years, a variety of circumstances left me feeling isolated: sickness with my dad at home, sisters who had moved out, struggling socially to connect, and an adopted style of christian-living that kept me at arms length from my peers. Add to that mix, a dash of puberty, and you have a recipe for vice that has taken me years to adequately address. </p>\n<p>During those years, my dad became sick with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a degenerative nerve disease that left him sick for a year, and recovering for much longer. My mom, who had stayed home while me and my two older sisters were growing up, had decided it was time to return to work and help support dad and the family. My sisters, who were 5 and 7 years older than me were either heavily involved with friends or moved out. Being young and devout in my faith, I adopted a serious, imbalanced, and isolationist attitude towards it which kept me making any friends outside of that community of believers.</p>\n<p>School and home life were lonely; my fervorously faith-informed attitude kept me from making friends at school, and I was often home alone in the evening for hours at a time. It was during this time that I found some comfort in boy-ish sexual exploration. Without proper support and healthy friendships, what started innocently-enough progressed into concerning behaviours in unhealthy attempts to assuage the loneliness, chaos, and negative self-esteem as perceived-outsider.   </p>\n<p>s</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Telling my story","date":"20 October, 2018"},"fields":{"slug":"/posts/my-story-with-sexual-addiction-p1/"},"wordCount":{"words":256}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/my-story-with-sexual-addiction-p1/","prev":{"frontmatter":{"type":"post","title":"Is it really a problem?"},"fields":{"slug":"/posts/is-it-really-a-problem/"}},"next":false}}
