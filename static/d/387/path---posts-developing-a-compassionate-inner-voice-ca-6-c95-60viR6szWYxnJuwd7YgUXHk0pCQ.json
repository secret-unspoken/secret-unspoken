To varying degrees, I’m sure we all are hard on ourselves at times. It became an impediment in my journey of recovery when it noticed “being hard on myself” was excessive mulling over social troubles, relationship misunderstandings, and personal shortcomings. </p>\n<p>I think we all know a “muller”; they’re are stuck in their own world, they may mutter to themselves, they may be a little absent even though physically present, or they may talk about something over and over. We may think that this is “who they are” (or “who we are”). </p>\n<p>Mulling comes at a cost, and sometimes it is hidden. It may cost a “muller” quality time with those they love. It may cost them some negativity. I may cost them frustration with their spouse. It is also possible that mulling points to a deeper issue: lack of self-compassion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Self-compassion, in short, is being as compassionate with yourself as you are with others</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Self-compassion, in short, is being as compassionate with yourself as you are with others. A good test of self-compassion is to imagine your issue as your friend’s issue, and then imagine how you would speak to them about it. What do you tell them? How do you contextualize their issue for them? What is your tone? Notice then how to you speak with yourself; is it the same or different. Do you give yourself the benefit of contextualizing the issue? How harsh is your tone?</p>\n<p>I think it is important for those who suffer with addictions to develop a compassionate inner voice. As mentioned many times before, a big part of addiction is shame, which confuses your actions with who you are. Shame is also perpetuated by the way you think of yourself, which means it is important to think truthfully about your shortcomings, so as not to feed into the cycle. </p>\n<p>Here are some exercises that would be helpful for you to do, if you even suspect that self-compassion may be an issue with you. Try them, and you may be surprised as how much you struggle to do them, or what you may tell yourself about these exercises, or your pain (“stupid”, “waste of time”, “not a big deal”). The next time you make a mistake, or get stuck on an issue:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talk to yourself as a good friend, or even as a child. Say kind words to yourself and don’t trivialize an issue or pain that you are going through. Be gentle with your failings.</li>\n<li>Contextualize your failing or shortcoming in the common human experience. Sometimes just admitting to yourself that what you did was wrong, but it was a human to do, is enough to come to terms with the wrong, but also enough to allow you to move on. This is important because while a failing or shortcoming might need correcting, there isn’t anything wrong with you that isn’t also wrong with the rest of us. And you need to hear yourself say that.</li>\n<li>Lastly, while a feeling can be overwhelming, we all need breaks. Allow yourself a distraction, and let yourself come back to it at a later time. This takes mindfulness to not allow yourself to be consumed by a feeling. Sometimes, stepping outside yourself for a minute to remind yourself “it’s just a feeling, and it will pass” can help you put the right emphasis what you feel. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Is your inner voice compassionate, or mercilessly self-critical? </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\n<p>More on <a href=\"https://self-compassion.org\">Self-Compassion</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Developing a compassionate inner voice","date":"2019-04-07","author":null,"description":null,"banner":null},"fields":{"slug":"/posts/developing-a-compassionate-inner-voice/"},"wordCount":{"words":597}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/developing-a-compassionate-inner-voice/","prev":{"frontmatter":{"type":"post","title":"Legitimate Need, Illegitimate way"},"fields":{"slug":"/posts/legitimate-need-illegitimate-way/"}},"next":false}}
