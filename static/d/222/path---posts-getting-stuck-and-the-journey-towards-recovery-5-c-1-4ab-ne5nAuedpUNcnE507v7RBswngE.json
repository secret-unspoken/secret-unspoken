During those years, a variety of circumstances left me feeling isolated: sickness with my dad at home, sisters who had moved out, struggling socially to connect, and an adopted style of faith that kept me at arms length from my peers. Add to that mix, a dash of puberty, and you have a recipe for vice that has taken me years to adequately address. </p>\n<p>During those years, my dad became sick with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a degenerative nerve disease that left him sick for a year, and recovering for much longer. My mom, who had stayed home while me and my two older sisters were growing up, had decided it was time to return to work and help support dad and the family. My sisters, who were 5 and 7 years older than me were either heavily involved with friends or moved out. Being young and devout in my faith, I adopted an isolationist attitude towards others which kept me making any friends outside of that community.</p>\n<p>School and home life were lonely; my fervorously faith-informed attitude kept me from making friends at school, and I was often home alone in the evening for hours at a time. It was during this time that I found some comfort in boy-ish sexual exploration. Without proper support and healthy friendships, what started innocently-enough progressed into concerning behaviours in unhealthy attempts to assuage the loneliness, chaos, and negative self-esteem as a perceived-outsider. </p>\n<p>Through the years, as the behaviour progressed to vice, I found myself stuck. Compounding the negative self esteem, I was ashamed of my behaviour and of what I must be if I was the kind of person who could be caught by it. I accepted that, for better of for worse, this would be my crutch throughout life, and I would have to try my best to deal with it. And that crutch was pornography. </p>\n<p>Depending on the stresses of life, this crutch stayed with me, sometimes more, sometimes less, until I was challenged. A friend invited me out to lunch one day, and for the last ten minutes of the conversation, told me about his struggle with sexual addiction. He shared with me some details about the nature of the problem, and frequency, and that he had been to workshop to try to deal with it. Uncomfortable with the topic, I was mostly focused on getting through until he mentioned near the end that he had been following the program and had been sober for one year.</p>\n<p>That caused me to shift in my seat. When lunch was over, I went back to work. That evening I had some thinking to do.</p>\n<p>My wife was aware that I had a problem with pornography but, as she later told me, she didn’t know that it was as problematic as it truly was. She always sensed something was wrong in our marriage, which was in part related to this issue. Years of shame and hiding left us disconnected to a degree. As I mention in previous posts, there is always a fear of discovery with those you love, that keeps you hiding on some level. Addicts fear this is something wrong with them at the core, and not just their behaviour.</p>\n<p>We decided that the workshop was worth a try. I attended a weekend workshop in Minneapolis called <a href=\"https://faithfulandtrue.com/\">Faithful &#x26; True</a>, a center specializing in sexual addiction, which was eye-opening. There were a variety of guys there from all different background, ages, and sexual struggles. A few things became clear to me that weekend: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>I wasn’t a bad person; there were reasonable explanations for my behavior</li>\n<li>Issues of my past were affecting me in the present</li>\n<li>The issues were emotional in nature, and I needed to work on emotional and mental health to see success</li>\n<li>I needed to be part of a community of men built on this issue, who were committed to recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from the first, two of my other friends attended, either before me, or after. That year following, 5 of us worked through the material we had been given, meeting weekly, working on community, the addiction directly, and emotional and mental health. I'm excited to elaborate on this later.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One of the cores to the success has been community around this issue. Part of what I would love to see come of sharing, is to challenge you, inspire you, and invite you to be a part of building of a better community around this issue. Statistically, most men find themselves stuck in this issue, but it is powerful enough to keep us isolated from each other. At a later time, I will share my vision with you guys of what I hope to see.</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for Part 2, where I’ll elaborate on the recovery aspect. <a href=\"https://secret-unspoken.github.io/subscribe\">Subscribe</a> and follow our updates on social media (links in footer).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting stuck and the journey towards recovery","date":"05 November, 2018"},"fields":{"slug":"/posts/getting-stuck-and-the-journey-towards-recovery/"},"wordCount":{"words":820}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/getting-stuck-and-the-journey-towards-recovery/","prev":{"frontmatter":{"type":"post","title":"Part 1: My story"},"fields":{"slug":"/posts/sexual-addiction-and-me-p1/"}},"next":false}}
