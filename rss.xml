During those years, a variety of circumstances left me feeling isolated: sickness with my dad at home, sisters who had moved out, struggling socially to connect, and an adopted style of faith that kept me at arms length from my peers. Add to that mix, a dash of puberty, and you have a recipe for vice that has taken me years to adequately address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During those years, my dad became sick with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a degenerative nerve disease that left him sick for a year, and recovering for much longer. My mom, who had stayed home while me and my two older sisters were growing up, had decided it was time to return to work and help support dad and the family. My sisters, who were 5 and 7 years older than me were either heavily involved with friends or moved out. Being young and imbalanced in my faith, I adopted an isolationist attitude towards others which kept me making any friends outside of that community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School and home life were lonely; my attitude kept me from making friends at school, and I was often home alone in the evening for hours at a time. It was during this time that I found some comfort in boy-ish sexual exploration. Without proper support and healthy friendships, what started innocently-enough progressed into concerning behaviours in unhealthy attempts to assuage the loneliness, chaos, and negative self-esteem as a perceived-outsider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the years, as the behaviour progressed to vice, I found myself stuck. Compounding the negative self esteem, I was ashamed of my behaviour and of what I must be if I was the kind of person who could be caught by it. I accepted that this would be my crutch throughout life, and I would have to try my best to deal with it. And that crutch was pornography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the stresses of life, this crutch stayed with me, sometimes more, sometimes less, until I was challenged. A friend invited me out to lunch one day, and for the last ten minutes of the conversation, told me about his struggle with sexual addiction. He shared with me some details about the nature of the problem, and frequency, and that he had been to workshop to try to deal with it. Uncomfortable with the topic, I was mostly focused on getting through until he mentioned near the end that he had been following the program and had been sober for one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That caused me to shift in my seat. When lunch was over, I went back to work. That evening I had some thinking to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife was aware that I had a problem with pornography but, as she later told me, she didn’t know that it was as problematic as it truly was. She always sensed something was wrong in our marriage, which was in part related to this issue. Years of shame and hiding left us disconnected to a degree. As I mention in previous posts, there is always a fear of discovery with those you love, that keeps you hiding on some level. Addicts fear there is something wrong with them at the core, and not just with their behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided that the workshop was worth a try. I attended a weekend workshop in Minneapolis called &lt;a href=&quot;https://faithfulandtrue.com/&quot;&gt;Faithful &amp;#x26; True&lt;/a&gt;, a center specializing in sexual addiction, which was eye-opening. There were a variety of guys there from all different background, ages, and sexual struggles. A few things became clear to me that weekend: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn’t a bad person; there were reasonable explanations for my behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues of my past were affecting me in the present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The issues were emotional in nature, and I needed to work on emotional and mental health to see success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed to be part of a community of men built on this issue, who were committed to recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the first, two of my other friends attended, either before me, or after. That year following, 5 of us worked through the material we had been given, meeting weekly, working on community, the addiction directly, and emotional and mental health and maturity. I&apos;m excited to elaborate on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the cores to the success has been community around this issue. Part of what I would love to see come of sharing, is to challenge you, inspire you, and invite you to be a part of building a better community around this issue. Statistically, most men find themselves stuck in this issue, but it is powerful enough to keep us isolated from each other. At a later time, I will share my vision with you guys of what I hope to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for Part 2, where I’ll elaborate on the recovery aspect. &lt;a href=&quot;https://secret-unspoken.github.io/subscribe&quot;&gt;Subscribe&lt;/a&gt; and follow our updates on social media (links in footer).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is it really a problem?]]></title><description><![CDATA[So maybe you are having a private struggle but you are wondering if it is a  real  problem.

With so much silence around the issue, and without anyone to share with, it is hard to tell and tough to be honest with ourselves; ultimately it is a question that we answer individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked the question for myself a few years ago, I went down this list&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and had to admit that I was to the point of being stuck: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to stop repeatedly, and being unable to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needing more, or progressing to worse behaviour to get the same effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing a tolerance to the effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the behaviour to manage emotional state. &quot;Medicating&quot; is often the term used when lowering your mood, but the behaviour can also be used to raise your mood. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persisting despite experiencing negative consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to admit that you might be stuck; there is a ton of shame around this issue that keeps men silent and keeps them from seeking help. But when you are stuck you need help, and there is help available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I had settled into a life of acceptance. It wasn&apos;t until a good friend shared his own story of sexual struggle, his drive to get help, and the freedom he was experiencing, that I decided life could be different for me. But it took honesty about my stuckness first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my hope to inspire you too. I&apos;ll be sharing more of my story soon on how I got help and how you can too. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the homepage of the blog, I briefly mention the dynamic between shame, hiding, and the cycle of stuckness men often find themselves in. This is no new thing. Since the earliest records, men have been hiding in response to doing wrong. One only needs to read the record of Adam to know that when he did wrong, he was afraid and so he hid. It can be a terribly frightening thing to risk exposure to those around us when we feel we have done wrong. And that fear and drive to hide can be even more powerful when we not only feel we&apos;ve done wrong, but that we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between &lt;em&gt;shame&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;guilt&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Guilt&lt;/em&gt; is about a behaviour, but behaviours can change. &lt;em&gt;Shame&lt;/em&gt; is a belief that touches on &lt;em&gt;who we are&lt;/em&gt;. It is a belief that something is wrong with &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Deeper than that, shame is a belief that something is wrong with me that isn&apos;t also wrong with the &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; of us. It is a failure to identify our failures as being part of the common human experience. It is a belief that nobody is as twisted and broken as I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame... is a belief that nobody is as twisted and broken as I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no wonder that men&apos;s sexual struggles are being met with silence, false transparency, and inexperience; so many men are still struggling silently, alone, and afraid to seek help. Paradoxically, I have found (and many others) that the making ourselves and our struggles known to other men in a safe community, is leading to less shame, more personal freedom, and stronger community.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
