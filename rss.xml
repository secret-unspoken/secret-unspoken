Nikki is my courageous partner and adventurer in life. She has experience on the issue as an affected spouse, and will be telling her own story from discovery throughout recovery. It is my hope that her story will bring spouses into the discussion, to challenge, inspire, and bring change into the lives of couples.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Nathan first asked me to guest write on his blog, I wasn’t really sure where to start. Recovery and addiction is such a broad and wide spectrum/topic and there are so many intricate details that go along with the journey, you don’t want to leave anything out. And how do you work it into conversations? “Hello, my husband is a sex addict.” Many people don’t even understand the terms, let alone why I chose to stay with all of the chaos, turmoil, and pain that comes from the unveiling of an addiction like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where does a wife or woman even begin?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll begin with this: I knew about Nathan’s issues with pornography right from the start of us dating. He had confided in me that he had struggles with this ever since he was a teen, but as we progressed in our relationship, I rarely saw this as a real problem. He seemed ok, he was functioning, he had a job, went to school, was active in his local church… he was the perfect man I was looking for. So what! if he had struggled with that. Most men do, I assumed, and therefore I put it out of my mind as a minor character flaw that I could work with, if the time ever came. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our marriage progressed I always felt there was something “off” but I could never put my finger on it. I didn’t have the proper words to describe what I felt was wrong, but I just had a gut feeling that our relationship wasn’t all it could be. But I continued on ad over time the distance started to feel like a chasm. It wasn’t until we started to talk about children that the issue started to become clearer in my mind; I started to pinpoint my feelings and began to realize that our relationship had not progressed as I expected. Nathan really wanted to start having children, and for some reason I just wasn’t. I knew I eventually wanted to be a mom, and I also felt like if we had a baby our relationship wouldn’t survive it. That was the thought that kept coming to my mind. And when I voiced this to him, he really took it to heart. I think this is when the thought of change started to take a hold in his mind. It&apos;s not that I didn’t want to have a baby, just not with him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resistance and Codependency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to January 2016. Nathan had told me about his conversation with his friend who had struggled with sexual addiction and I could tell it really shook him. I didn’t quite fully understand the gravity of that conversation because I really hadn’t thought Nathan had an “addiction”. I had somehow convinced myself that this was just something men needed to do from time to time and that if I wasn’t available, then what could the harm be? Deep down, I didn’t like it, but again, this was the level of denial and surviving I was doing in order to just be with Nathan and not cause any rifts.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He then mentioned a conference in the states that could help him in the way he needed. I was pretty hesitant at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much would a weekend change a person, really? I was pretty skeptical. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was pretty pricey just for three days, plus the airfare and hotels. We just didn’t have the finances to pull it off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nathan was insistent. In fact, I had never seen him so sure and passionate about doing something that, so I thought that if he comes out of it with any sort of help for himself, maybe it’s not a bad idea. I agreed and off he went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he came back after that weekend, I could sense a difference in him, but I didn’t quite understand what change I was seeing. The Nathan I knew was survivor Nathan. The Nathan that buried things, hid from issues, and was a very calm and logical person outwardly. This new person was (in my opinion) irrational, angered easily, overly sensitive and yet at peace with all these new and different emotions he was going through. I couldn’t make sense of it all. There were many new fights, sleepless nights, and tear-filled nights. And all i could think about is, &quot;and this guy wants to have kids with me? Now??&quot;. He had to be insane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finding community&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until I spoke with our friend’s wife that I realized I wasn’t alone. She was going through the same thing, only she had gone to the counterpart of the conference, aimed at the spouses of these men who had dealt (and were still dealing) with sexual addiction. There was a peace and turmoil in her that I didn’t understand but felt better that I wasn’t alone.   She suggested I go because it would not only help me understand the struggle that my husband was going through but it would be healing for me as well. I wasn’t sure what she meant, and quite frankly, my attitude was, this is his problem, not mine. I don’t need any healing or help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, after much debate in my heart and head, I went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The journey there and back again&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first got there, I noticed the small, quaint room had boxes of tissues everywhere. I almost immediately got a pit in my stomach, wondering what I had signed up for here. As the weekend progressed, I learned there were many different women who were struggling to connect with their husbands in ways that I was, but were unable to because of this addiction. It was also here that I learned this addiction predated me. That it had nothing to do with me. It also taught me that I had a lot of bitterness, anger and resentment towards Nathan that I had buried for years. It also taught me the ideas that I had taught or told myself over the years and how I coped with those ideas. We had small groups where we shared our own histories and learned about our own expectations in our marriages, of ourselves and where they came from in relation to our upbringing and childhoods. It was astounding. I learned so many things about myself that I didn’t even know existed and I was able to develop the language that I so desperately needed to communicate to my husband that had been missing for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I came home, the first thing I did was hug my husband. I knew the journey would not be easy from here on out. I also knew it wouldn’t be all puppies and roses. Just because you can understand someone’s struggles doesn’t mean your human nature won’t creep back in and cause you to doubt your own thoughts and emotions. In the two years leading up to this blog, Nathan and I have been through individual counseling and marriage counseling to help heal those parts of our relationship that have been affected by the pain of addiction and how we BOTH coped with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, whenever Nathan would &quot;act out&quot; or turn to his “drug”, the ideas or thoughts that I would have in order to cope were denial and apathy. But really what I was feeling was anger and resentment. Anger that he’s choose that over me, that he wouldn’t try and fix the problem or that he would try and hide from me. In his distance from me, I knew he had done something wrong; why couldn’t he just tell me? The ideas then that would follow this line of thought was that I was unworthy to be loved or cherished and I would cope by shopping (spending money that we didn’t have - which would always end in a fight) or I would wish for a different life. Now these things don’t sound so bad, but in reality, spending money that i knew we didn’t have would always set Nathan off and my thought life in wanting a different life was certainly not pure. And my apathy towards this made me almost numb to the pain I was causing myself in our marriage. In reaction to Nathan acting out, not only would these thoughts plague me but my attitude was unhelpful and dysfunctional. I would ice Nathan out and punish him by abstaining from any type of relationship; trying to make him feel my pain by giving him the cold shoulder to try and make him feel even more guilty for how he made me feel. This could go on for hours to days at a time. I thought i was justified in my behaviour. But all it did was push away the connection I so desperately wanted with my husband. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost three years after going to this conference now, and my perspective on people has changed. I used to think that people were incapable of change. My cynicism knew no bounds when it came to people. I just had never seen true change demonstrated in way that was believable and lasting. Understand, both Nathan and I are not perfect now. We still struggle in going backwards to how we used to cope with problems. Believe me, this addiction can permeate through every aspect of your relationship and how you cope with issues with each other. And likewise the healing does not stop at just the behvaiour, but is something that filters into all areas of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all the pain and choas of the journey, I&apos;m proud of the changes that my husband has made, and the sacrifice he has been willing to make to improve himself and our marriage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Part Two: Recovery]]></title><description><![CDATA[I've been asked how I have been working on my own recovery, and I get the sense that most people are listening for a silver bullet.

I think the best way to answer this is to continue the story that I have been telling. I finished the &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/moving-on-and-getting-over/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; with what I had learned coming away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://faithfulandtrue.com/&quot;&gt;Faithful &amp;#x26; True&lt;/a&gt;; I needed to work on the addiction directly, emotional and mental health, and on community. So how did I go about that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&apos;s start with the program. Similar to Alcoholics Anonymous&apos; 12 steps, there are 7 steps to this program, which follow quite closely with AA. There is no need to get into it, except to note that, like AA, there is no silver bullet to conquering the addiction. But following the program does yield results. At a high level, it involves admitting unmanageability and surrending control, accepting help from God as you understand him and others, accountability inside of community, reparations, and spreading hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Man-culture: I don&apos;t have feelings, nothing bothers me, and I don&apos;t need anything from anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as working through the program, I spent my first 60 days in daily contact with another member. This is done for a few reasons. These first few days are challenging as you are adjusting from addiction-brain. Your brain needs a chance to physically change how it works off-drug, and daily accountability keeps you on-track. These daily meetings take a certain form that get you used to expressing what you are feeling, issues you are experiencing, and needs that others can help with. It felt a little contrived, to be honest, but the process did reveal a few things to me in short order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was under-developed emotionally, and hardly able to identify what I was feeling beyond such basic words as &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was uncomfortable talking about my own issues.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I found it difficult to express needs to other men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know now that these 3 experiences are very common among men. If I could put man-culture (&quot;machoism&quot;) into words it would be: &lt;em&gt;I don&apos;t have feelings, nothing bothers me, and I don&apos;t need anything from anybody&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a good deal of the process delving into my past to understand how the addiction came about and why. As I tell the story in the &lt;a href=&quot;/posts/moving-on-and-getting-over/&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I had developed boy-ish ways of coping and burying feelings of loneliness and depression. For me to learn better ways, I had to spend some time studying my own past, and learning the story of how and why I became addicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I shed a lot of tears thinking about my past. I didn&apos;t expect to find pain, but I did. And through the process, I came to terms with a lot beliefs I had about myself that the addiction had fueled, and found ways to change them. I am a healthier person today because of facing these issues. Moving towards my pain, and grieving losses proved to be one of the healthiest parts of this process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addiction moves in cycles, and is fueled by your own woundedness. [...] the cycle goes on almost unconciously for many.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the program involves studying the dynamics of addiction. Addiction moves in cycles, and is fueled by your own woundedness. Moving between fantasy, ritual, acting out, and despair, the cycle goes on almost unconciously for many. Bringing this to the concious level, we studied our own justifications and entitlements, studying the path that lead us to trouble, defining our own sobriety, and drawing boundaries for ourselves. I have been asked privately about strategies for dealing with this, and while defining the addiction is part of that, the real work is in building the emotional maturity, personal awareness, and healthy community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this work was done within a safe community of other committed guys. And in so doing, we&apos;ve built a tight-knit community together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how about you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What does your community look like?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you able to identify your highs and lows this week without using the words &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;? If you cannot, why do you think that is?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has your experience of &quot;man-culture&quot; been similar or different?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

During those years, a variety of circumstances left me feeling isolated: sickness with my dad at home, sisters who had moved out, struggling socially to connect, and an adopted style of faith that kept me at arms length from my peers. Add to that mix, a dash of puberty, and you have a recipe for vice that has taken me years to adequately address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During those years, my dad became sick with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a degenerative nerve disease that left him sick for a year, and recovering for much longer. My mom, who had stayed home while me and my two older sisters were growing up, had decided it was time to return to work and help support dad and the family. My sisters, who were 5 and 7 years older than me were either heavily involved with friends or moved out. Being young and imbalanced in my faith, I adopted an isolationist attitude towards others which kept me making any friends outside of that community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;School and home life were lonely; my attitude kept me from making friends at school, and I was often home alone in the evening for hours at a time. It was during this time that I found some comfort in boy-ish sexual exploration. Without proper support and healthy friendships, what started innocently-enough progressed into concerning behaviours in unhealthy attempts to assuage the loneliness, chaos, and negative self-esteem as a perceived-outsider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the years, as the behaviour progressed to vice, I found myself stuck. Compounding the negative self esteem, I was ashamed of my behaviour and of what I must be if I was the kind of person who could be caught by it. I accepted that this would be my crutch throughout life, and I would have to try my best to deal with it. And that crutch was pornography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on the stresses of life, this crutch stayed with me, sometimes more, sometimes less, until I was challenged. A friend invited me out to lunch one day, and for the last ten minutes of the conversation, told me about his struggle with sexual addiction. He shared with me some details about the nature of the problem, and frequency, and that he had been to workshop to try to deal with it. Uncomfortable with the topic, I was mostly focused on getting through until he mentioned near the end that he had been following the program and had been sober for one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That caused me to shift in my seat. When lunch was over, I went back to work. That evening I had some thinking to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife was aware that I had a problem with pornography but, as she later told me, she didn’t know that it was as problematic as it truly was. She always sensed something was wrong in our marriage, which was in part related to this issue. Years of shame and hiding left us disconnected to a degree. As I mention in previous posts, there is always a fear of discovery with those you love, that keeps you hiding on some level. Addicts fear there is something wrong with them at the core, and not just with their behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided that the workshop was worth a try. I attended a weekend workshop in Minneapolis called &lt;a href=&quot;https://faithfulandtrue.com/&quot;&gt;Faithful &amp;#x26; True&lt;/a&gt;, a center specializing in sexual addiction, which was eye-opening. There were a variety of guys there from all different background, ages, and sexual struggles. A few things became clear to me that weekend: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I wasn’t a bad person; there were reasonable explanations for my behavior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Issues of my past were affecting me in the present&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The issues were emotional in nature, and I needed to work on emotional and mental health to see success&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I needed to be part of a community of men built on this issue, who were committed to recovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the first, two of my other friends attended, either before me, or after. That year following, 5 of us worked through the material we had been given, meeting weekly, working on community, the addiction directly, and emotional and mental health and maturity. I&apos;m excited to elaborate on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the cores to the success has been community around this issue. Part of what I would love to see come of sharing, is to challenge you, inspire you, and invite you to be a part of building a better community around this issue. Statistically, most men find themselves stuck in this issue, but it is powerful enough to keep us isolated from each other. At a later time, I will share my vision with you guys of what I hope to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for Part 2, where I’ll elaborate on the recovery aspect. &lt;a href=&quot;/subscribe&quot;&gt;Subscribe&lt;/a&gt; and follow our updates on social media (links in footer).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is it really a problem?]]></title><description><![CDATA[So maybe you are having a private struggle but you are wondering if it is a  real  problem.

With so much silence around the issue, and without anyone to share with, it is hard to tell and tough to be honest with ourselves; ultimately it is a question that we answer individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I asked the question for myself a few years ago, I went down this list&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and had to admit that I was to the point of being stuck: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trying to stop repeatedly, and being unable to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Needing more, or progressing to worse behaviour to get the same effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Developing a tolerance to the effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the behaviour to manage emotional state. &quot;Medicating&quot; is often the term used when lowering your mood, but the behaviour can also be used to raise your mood. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Persisting despite experiencing negative consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to admit that you might be stuck; there is a ton of shame around this issue that keeps men silent and keeps them from seeking help. But when you are stuck you need help, and there is help available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I had settled into a life of acceptance. It wasn&apos;t until a good friend shared his own story of sexual struggle, his drive to get help, and the freedom he was experiencing, that I decided life could be different for me. But it took honesty about my stuckness first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my hope to inspire you too. I&apos;ll be sharing more of my story soon on how I got help and how you can too. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the homepage of the blog, I briefly mention the dynamic between shame, hiding, and the cycle of stuckness men often find themselves in. This is no new thing. Since the earliest records, men have been hiding in response to doing wrong. One only needs to read the record of Adam to know that when he did wrong, he was afraid and so he hid. It can be a terribly frightening thing to risk exposure to those around us when we feel we have done wrong. And that fear and drive to hide can be even more powerful when we not only feel we&apos;ve done wrong, but that we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a difference between &lt;em&gt;shame&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;guilt&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Guilt&lt;/em&gt; is about a behaviour, but behaviours can change. &lt;em&gt;Shame&lt;/em&gt; is a belief that touches on &lt;em&gt;who we are&lt;/em&gt;. It is a belief that something is wrong with &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. Deeper than that, shame is a belief that something is wrong with me that isn&apos;t also wrong with the &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; of us. It is a failure to identify our failures as being part of the common human experience. It is a belief that nobody is as twisted and broken as I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shame... is a belief that nobody is as twisted and broken as I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no wonder that men&apos;s sexual struggles are being met with silence, false transparency, and inexperience; so many men are still struggling silently, alone, and afraid to seek help. Paradoxically, I have found (and many others) that the making ourselves and our struggles known to other men in a safe community, is leading to less shame, more personal freedom, and stronger community.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
